# R Regression Analysis

This project demonstrates linear regression using R on two built-in datasets: `mtcars` and `iris`. The goal is to explore the relationship between selected variables, fit regression models, and visualize the results.

## Datasets Used
- **mtcars**: Predicting miles per gallon (`mpg`) from car weight (`wt`)
- **iris**: Predicting sepal length (`Sepal.Length`) from petal length (`Petal.Length`) for the species *setosa*

## Results
- In `mtcars`, as weight increases, fuel efficiency decreases (negative linear relationship).
- In `iris` (Setosa), there's a moderate positive correlation between petal length and sepal length.

## Plots
The output plots are saved as:
- `plots/mtcars_regression.png`
- `plots/iris_regression.png`

These plots show scatter points along with the best-fit regression lines.
